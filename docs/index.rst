Project Overview
----------------
secoundbrain is a long-term knowledge and context layer for personal or team-curated knowledge. It is strictly read-only, focused on context, relationships, and memory, and never performs analysis, scoring, or decision-making.

Features
--------
- Consumes human-readable Markdown notes (e.g., from Obsidian vaults)
- Indexes, links, and retrieves context
- No feedback or influence on source systems
- LLMs are used only for summarization, clustering, similarity search, and navigation
